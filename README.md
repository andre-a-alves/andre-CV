## What is andre-CV?
  When I was preparing my resume for internship applications to positions in the United States while simultaneously creating CVs for internship applications for positions in Germany, I became quite frustrated at how much work it took to update each resume and/or CV and the issues associated with combining appropriately-formatted cover letters with those documents.
  I was also disappointed with templates that were easily found online.

  This project represents what I came up with to solve my own resume/CV requirements, and I hope others can take advantage of it for the same purpose.

  The German cover letter roughly adheres to the DIN 5008 guidelines when compiled using 11 point Source Code Sans font.

## Beta Release
  As this project is still in beta, there is no intention to make future release backwards compatible.

  * Support for a two-column resume style.
  * Lower-level TeX class definitions.
  * Additional language support.
  * Additional optional website link support.
  * BibTeX-based publication support.
  * Simplified LaTeX-based syntax for document creation, including
    * Use of `\section{}` for CV/resume sections.
    * Eliminating the need for a `\cvpara{}` environment.
    * Use of an environment for making cover letters.
    * Supporting both Form A and Form B German cover letters.
